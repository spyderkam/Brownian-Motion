# Brownian Motion (readme is out of date)

Bead class to define Brownian particles. Simulation class based on Bead class for multi-Bead simulations.


<!--- * `brownian_bead_FENE` is also a simulation for the ideal chain/Rouse model but for a FENE force spring (see Wiki); which is what is ultimately desired. --->
* `brownian_bead` replaces the Hookean force with a FENE force as well as taking into consideration a repulsive force when beads come into contact. The repuslive force follows Hooke's law.

Apply this with the accompanying scripts (yet to upload).
