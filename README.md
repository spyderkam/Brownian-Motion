# Brownian Motion

Bead class to define Brownian particles. Simulation class based on Bead class for multi-Bead simulations.


* `brownian_bead_hookian` is a simulation for the ideal chain/Rouse model with a Hookian spring $(F=-kx)$.  
* `brownian_bead_FENE` is also a simulation for the ideal chain/Rouse model but for a FENE force spring (see Wiki); which is what is ultimately desired.
* `brownian_bead` takes into consideration overlapping beads.
